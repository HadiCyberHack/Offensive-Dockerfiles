* Adding them as I go. Don't expect production-ready images.  
* Most will be on the Docker hub repository as auto-build for convenience.  
* Auto-builds will trigger when source project pushes to master their respective master branches.
* Most images have a small README.md for basic usage.
* Feedback welcomed
